Originally the site of forts built for the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, the community surrounding the land started using it as public space shortly after the threat of the War of 1812 passed. By 1847, it was designated a park (Brooklyn's first), and twenty years later, famed landscape architects Olmsted and Vaux began designing its new layout. In 1897, the park, formerly known as Washington Park, received its name."

After all that relaxing, lace up your sneakers and jog a lap around the state-of-the-art track reopened in 2006. If team sports are more your style, meet some friends at the soccer, football, or baseball fields, all of which have also been recently renovated.

  "description" : "Hunts Point Riverside Park is a gateway to the revitalized Bronx River, a major connector to the Bronx River Greenway, and a home to kayakers, canoers, and paddlers from across the city.<br/><br/>This park, once an illegal dumping ground, has been transformed into a waterfront oasis, with a pier for fishing, and a kayak and canoe launch. Even the spray shower and playground takes the shape of built-in canoes, as kids can safely play in the 'water' on hot days."
